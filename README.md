# EX-02-Cross-Platform-Prompting-Evaluating-Diverse-Techniques-in-AI-Powered-Text-Summarization

## AIM
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

## Scenario:
You are part of a content curation team for an educational platform that delivers quick summaries of research papers to undergraduate students. Your task is to summarize a 500-word technical article on "The Basics of Blockchain Technology" using multiple AI platforms and prompting strategies.

Your goal is to determine which combination of prompting technique + platform provides the best summary in terms of:

Accuracy

Coherence

Simplicity

Speed

User experience

## Algorithm
1. **Article Selection**
   Select a \~500-word technical article titled *"The Basics of Blockchain Technology"*.

2. **Prompting Strategies Definition**
   Prepare the following four prompting strategies:

   * **Zero-shot**: Directly ask the model to summarize without examples.
   * **Few-shot**: Provide 2–3 examples of summaries for similar technical texts before asking for the summary.
   * **Chain-of-Thought**: Prompt the model to explain or break down the text logically before summarizing.
   * **Role-based**: Instruct the model to act as a specific role (e.g., “a university professor summarizing for freshmen”).

3. **Platform Selection**
   Use the following AI platforms:

   * ChatGPT (OpenAI)
   * Gemini (Google)
   * Claude (Anthropic)
   * Copilot (Microsoft)

4. **Execution**
   For each platform:

   * Apply each prompting strategy using the same input article.
   * Record the output summary.
   * Note time taken to generate the summary.

5. **Evaluation Criteria**
   Evaluate each generated summary using the following:

   * **Accuracy**: Does the summary correctly capture the main points of the article?
   * **Coherence**: Is the summary logically structured and easy to follow?
   * **Simplicity**: Is the language accessible for undergraduate students?
   * **Speed**: How fast is the response?
   * **User Experience**: Was the interface intuitive, and was the output easy to copy/save?

6. **Scoring & Analysis**

   * Assign scores (1 to 5) for each criterion across all combinations.
   * Tabulate results for comparison.
   * Identify the best-performing strategy-platform combination.
